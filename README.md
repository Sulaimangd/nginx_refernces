# nginx_refernces
This repo I use as referrence for nginx configuration files. i will keep updating this repo whenever is possible. Warning: Do no use these files for your production, instead use them to learn more about nginx configuration file!

* The nginx.conf file is the main configuration file on nginx server. It's located in "/etc/nginx/" path on linux. the nginx.conf is condsidered the global configration file, this means it applies to the entier nginx server.
